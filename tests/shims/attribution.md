## Cross-Runtime Testing Framework

This test shim is based on the excellent cross-runtime testing libraries from the cross-org organization:

- **@cross/test** - Minimal testing framework for Deno, Bun, and Node.js
  - Repository: https://github.com/cross-org/test
  - JSR: https://jsr.io/@cross/test
  - License: MIT

- **@cross/runtime** - Cross-runtime environment detection
  - Repository: https://github.com/cross-org/runtime

Special thanks to the developers and contributors who have made these essential cross-runtime tools possible.
